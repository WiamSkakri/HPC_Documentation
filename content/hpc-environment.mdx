# Setting Up a Virtual Environment in HPC

# Note on Virtual Environment Creation

It is best practice to load the python module before initializing your virtual environment on HPC. If you make sure to follow this practice, you will not need to lead your python module inside the virtual environment every time you reactivate it. 

To make sure this is always done properly, please make sure to source the bash file provided before proceeding with any action on your HPC home directory. Running this file will make sure that all your dependencies are in order.

## The bash file to source

```bash

#!/usr/bin/env bash
  
module use /home/nkt8/.usr/local/share/modulefiles
module load SYCL/2024.0.1.46
module load cuDNN
module load CUDA/12.3.0
module load Python/3.12.3-GCCcore-13.3.0
```

## How to use this bash file

1. Creating the bash file using vim

```bash
vim RUNMEFIRST.sh
```

1. Copy and past the above script into vim

```bash
# press i to enter the INSERT mdoe
# paste the script
# press ESC then type :wq! to save and quite vim
```

1. Sourcing the file inside the current shell

```bash
source RUNMEFIRST.sh
```

# Setting up a virtual environment

Below I will walk you through how to start a virtual environment

### Creating a new env

```vhdl
python -m venv ~/myenv
```

### Activating the env

```vhdl
source ~/myenv/bin/activate
```

### Deactivating the env

```vhdl
deactivate
```

### Deleting the env

```vhdl
rm -rf ~/myenv
```

### Listing your environment installed libraries and package dependencies

```vhdl
pip list
```

# Loading a python Module

In case you find yourself in a situation where you need to load a specific python module, please refer to the steps bellow

### Listing all modules

```vhdl
module avail python
```

### Choosing a module (Loading an example)

```vhdl
module load Python/3.12.3-GCCcore-13.3.0
```

### Checking the load

```vhdl
python --version
python3 --version
```
